1) Open Bash Shell
2) Within the Bash shell, navigate to the "InventoryDatabase" file that is within the inventory-management-system folder
3) Then run the command in bash shell: psql -U user_name -d database_name  (It doesnt matter what you put for database_name, and the user_name is by default postgres)
4) Just choose default options for entering into psql shell (simply keep pressing "Enter")
5) Then, run the command: \i queries, this will execute the queries SQL script and generate your tables and data


You should now be able to see the Tables and Data when you open PgAdmin (GUI for Postgres)!
